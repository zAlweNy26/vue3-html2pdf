# Html2Pdf with Vue 3

This library provides a simple way to convert HTML to PDF using Vue 3.

You can use:

- A component to convert HTML to PDF named `Html2Pdf`.
- A composable to convert HTML to PDF named `useHtml2Pdf`.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## How to install

```bash
npm install github:zAlweNy26/vue3-html2pdf
```

I didn't publish it to npm because I don't know if this library is really necessary.
